    "In this tutorial, you'll discover how to use \"deep learning\" (DL) to classify digits, ranging from 0 to 9. The dataset is quite famous, it's called 'MNIST' http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. A French guy put it up, very famous in the DL comunity, he's called Yann Lecun and is now both head of the Facebook AI reseach program and head of something in the University of New York (you may want to search and pull the answer :p ).\n",
    "\n",
    "I invite you to discover how MNIST truly is (class distribution, pixels distribution...).  \n",
    "Luckilly for you, I managed to be organised this time, and you may find [this notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/marc-moreaux/Deep-Learning-classes/blob/master/notebooks/dataset_MNIST.ipynb) usefull.\n",

    "Remember logistic regression ? I also happen to have a notebook about this [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/marc-moreaux/Deep-Learning-classes/blob/master/notebooks/Logistic_regression.ipynb). It's all done with Keras and might help you"
