# Deep learning applied to image and sound classification @ECE_Paris (2017)




This class will go through :

---
## 1. Introduction
In the first class, we'll define the concept of classification which will be applied to both visual and audio signals.
Throughout the class, the datasets we'll explore are:
- [MNIST](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/marc-moreaux/Deep-Learning-classes/blob/master/notebooks/dataset_MNIST.ipynb)
- [Audio signals]()
- [Stock data]()

Throughout the years, many techniques have been used to perform visual classification:
- hubel and wiessel 1959, response to visual stimuli 
- Larry Roberts 1963, extracting 3D geometrical information from 2D perspective views of blocks, Blocks World.
- Generalized cylinder model, biederman 1987 [recognition by components](https://www.google.fr/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjp46-fuf7UAhUC1hQKHdZjDbYQFggoMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs.cmu.edu%2F~efros%2Fcourses%2FLBMV09%2Fpresentations%2FObjectsParts.ppt&usg=AFQjCNF6ZRmjAYKnSe_NgcMKh4UDcFVrYQ)
- SIFT 1999
- HOG and deformable parts 2009
- Deep learning and brain syllogism

Lets take a look at some classification techniques easy to experiment with [What is classification](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/marc-moreaux/Deep-Learning-classes/blob/master/notebooks/Classification.ipynb)

## 2-3. Little step into DL
As an introduction to deep learning, we start with [Linear regression](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/marc-moreaux/Deep-Learning-classes/blob/master/notebooks/linear_regression.ipynb), where we explain the basics of artificial neurons, distances, loss, and gradient descent.

Afterwards, we dig deeper into Deep Learning with [logistic regression](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/marc-moreaux/Deep-Learning-classes/blob/master/notebooks/Logistic_regression.ipynb) and [multinomial logistic regression]()

---
## 4. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
As this classification and brainy idea is understood, we go further into image and audio classification with [Convolutional Neural Network]() (CNN) in a multinomial logistic regression problem and start experimenting with different activation functions and some new issues:
- [Activation functions](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/marc-moreaux/Deep-Learning-classes/blob/master/notebooks/activation.ipynb)
- [Weights initialization](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/marc-moreaux/Deep-Learning-classes/blob/master/notebooks/activations_initializers.ipynb)
- [optimizers]()

---
## 5. Upscale our classification
We upscale our classifications problems to recognize real world sounds or images using famous frameworks as Tensorflow or Keras.

- [Keras example]()
