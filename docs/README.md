# Deep Learning Classes 2017 @ECE_Paris




This class will go through :

1. Linear and Logistic regression
    - Linear regression
    - Back propagation
    - Optimizer

2. Deep neural networks




We want to evaluate the effect of x on y, to give a prediction on y given x.  
We use a linear model : $$Y_i = \alpha + \beta.x_i + \epsilon_i$$  
Introducing the believe that $Y_i$ is a linear function of $x_i$, assuming an error $\epsilon_i$
